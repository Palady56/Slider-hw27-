# Image Slider

This repository contains an implementation of an image slider using three different methods: Functional, Prototype, and Class-based. The slider includes features such as auto-slide, pause/play functionality, image navigation, and indicators.

## Features

- **Auto-slide**: Automatically transitions between images at a specified interval.
- **Pause/Play**: Toggle the slider between paused and playing states.
- **Navigation**: Move to the previous or next image using buttons or keyboard arrows.
- **Indicators**: Display and interact with indicators for quick navigation to specific images.
- **Drag/Swipe**: Navigate images using drag or swipe gestures.

## Methods Implemented

1. **Functional Method**: A simple approach using functions to handle slider logic.
2. **Prototype Method**: An implementation based on JavaScript prototypes for defining the slider behavior.
3. **Class-based Method**: A modern approach using ES6 classes for a more structured and object-oriented implementation.

## Getting Started
